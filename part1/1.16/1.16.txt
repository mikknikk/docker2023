Keksinklikkaaja is a Cookie Clicker clone React app.

The Dockerfile was deployed to fly.io using the fly launch command.

Docker takes a Node image, copies the files, does some npm stuff, exposes the port 3000, and serves the game.

The game is running at https://keksinklikkaaja.fly.dev/

(The game was later converted into a simpler JavaScript app and also the Dockerfile was changed in exercises from part 3.)
